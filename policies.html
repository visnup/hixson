<h2>Payment and Insurance</h2>
<p>Hixson Urology currently participates in most major insurance plans, including
Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Cigna, United Healthcare, Aetna, Medicare and most
Medicare Advantage Plans. We also participate in most commercial insurance
plans. We do not participate in TennCare/BlueCare or HealthSpring. If you are
insured through a company other than these listed, we also submit these claims
to the appropriate carriers for you. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that you are responsible for all co-pays and deductibles,
which will be collected at the time of service. You may pay with cash, check or
credit card. If you are unable to pay the co-pay or deductible, your
appointment will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>If there is a discrepancy, it will be your responsibility to appeal to your
carrier for payment. Our policy if you are self-pay is to expect payment at the
time of service. For questions or information concerning your account or if we
participate in your particular insurance plan, please call the Billing Office
at (423) 877-2844.</p>
<h2>Prescription Refills</h2>
<p>Due to the volume of phone calls, we ask you to allow 24 hours for your request
to be completed.</p>
<p>If you need pain medication refills, please be sure to call us several days
before you run out. Also, please make your request early in the week (Monday
through Thursday) so that your doctor can address this. It is our office policy
not to refill pain medications after hours or on weekends. The on-call doctor
will not refill these medications.</p>
<p>Many insurance companies require “prior authorization” before filling your
prescription request. Therefore, depending on the speed with which your
insurance company responds, it may take up to seven business days for approval.
Please be patient.</p>
<p>If you have not seen one of our doctors within the past calendar year, we may
request that you make an office appointment with our physician or request the
medication from your primary care physician. Your health and well-being is our
greatest concern.</p>
<p>Often times, we are able to give samples of medications to try prior to writing
a prescription. Unfortunately, we are unable to keep patients supplied with
these medications indefinitely.</p>
<h2>Medical records and Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Hixson Urology follows HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996) guidelines and accordingly maintains all information related to
patients and medical care in the strictest confidence. For more information,
please download HIPAA’s fact sheet “<a href="/#">Your Health Information Privacy
Rights</a>.”</p>
<p>We will not disclose your record to others unless you direct us to do so or
unless the law authorizes or compels us to do so. With appropriate
authorization, copies of a portion or all of your medical records will be
released to the appropriate party or designated person(s). In order for us to
release your records, please fill out our <a href="/forms/release.pdf">permission to RELEASE medical
records form</a>. In the event that you would like us to obtain your records,
please fill out our <a href="/forms/obtain.pdf">permission to OBTAIN medical records form</a>.</p>
<h2>After hours/On-call</h2>
<p>Our Physicians share on-call responsibilities. If you need to speak to a doctor
after regular office hours, our answering service will contact the physician
on-call and your call will be returned promptly — to reach the answering
service, call our office number at (423) 877-2844. Our answering service will
relay your message to the physician on call.</p>
<p>If you need more emergent assistance, please call 911 or go to the nearest
Emergency Room. Our doctors prefer that you go to the Memorial Hospital Hixson
ER if at all possible. We have a relationship with Memorial Hospital Glenwood
ER, but do not provide routine emergency assistance there. We do not have a
relationship with the Parkridge ER, and you will have to be transferred by
ambulance for us to see you emergently.</p>
<p>For non-urgent concerns, including test results, prescription refills, and
appointment scheduling, please call our office during normal business hours
when your records are available.</p>
<h2>Telephone calls</h2>
<p>We welcome and encourage you to call the office if you have a problem or
question. In order for us to prioritize calls, we ask patients to let the
receptionist know the nature of your problem or questions. Genuine emergencies
are our first priority. Urgent calls are handled as soon as possible, and
non-emergent calls are returned as time permits throughout the day and after
office hours.</p>
<h2>Test results</h2>
<p>Lab and radiology test results will be given out by the doctor or medical
assistant only. However, test results will only be released after the doctor
has had a chance to review them. There is a wide variance regarding how long
various results can take. Please understand that we aim to provide you with the
most precise and accurate results possible, which sometimes take more time than
we would like. If you have not been informed of your test results within seven
business days, please call us.</p>
<h2>Work forms</h2>
<p>Our office staff will complete FMLA and work disability forms upon request.
