Patients are seen by appointment only. We welcome new patients and referrals from other physicians. We participate in most major insurance programs and Medicare. Co-pays and deductibles are collected at the time of service, as is directed by your contract with the insurance company. Patients are seen Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 5 PM. When possible, please cancel an appointment at least 24 hours in advance. You are welcome to bring a friend, spouse, or parent with you, although due to space considerations, we respectfully ask that you bring only one companion. For an appointment, please call 423-877-2844.
