New Patients
============

Welcome to Hixson Urology. We aim to continuously improve the health of our
patients and deliver the personal service required to provide a smooth clinical
experience.

In order to expedite your first visit with us, our website provides the paper
work needed so that we may begin your electronic medical chart. We kindly
request that you [print and fill out the following new patient forms][1] before
your first appointment with us and bring them along with the following:

  -	Your up-to-date insurance card
  -	A valid photo ID
  -	A referral (if required) from your primary care physician
  -	A list of all current medications
  -	Additional test results, imaging reports, or pertinent medical records 
  -	Insurance co-pay or required prepayment

We request you arrive early (30 minutes) prior to your scheduled appointment.
This allows you time to find parking and our office, as well as to allow our
office staff to get you to your doctor visit on time. 

We value your time and make every effort to run on schedule. We look forward to
providing you and your family with highest quality urologic care in a
professional setting.
