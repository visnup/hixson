Office Policies

	•	Payment and Insurance
Hixson Urology currently participates in most major insurance plans, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Cigna, United Healthcare, Aetna, Medicare and most Medicare Advantage Plans.  We also participate in most commercial insurance plans.  We do not participate in TennCare/BlueCare or HealthSpring.  If you are insured through a company other than these listed, we also submit these claims to the appropriate carriers for you. 

Please keep in mind that you are responsible for all co-pays and deductibles, which will be collected at the time of service. You may pay with cash, check or credit card. If you are unable to pay the co-pay or deductible, your appointment will be rescheduled. .

If there is a discrepancy, it will be your responsibility to appeal to your carrier for payment. Our policy if you are self-pay is to expect payment at the time of service. For questions or information concerning your account or if we participate in your particular insurance plan, please call the Billing Office at (423)877-2844.

	•	Prescription Refills
Due to the volume of phone calls, we ask you to allow 24 hours for your request to be completed.

If you need pain medication refills, please be sure to call us several days before you run out. Also, please make your request early in the week (Monday through Thursday) so that your doctor can address this. It is our office policy not to refill pain medications after hours or on weekends. The on-call doctor will not refill these medications.

Many insurance companies require “prior authorization” before filling your prescription request. Therefore, depending on the speed with which your insurance company responds, it may take up to seven business days for approval. Please be patient.

If you have not seen one of our doctors within the past calendar year, we may request that you make an office appointment with our physician or request the medication from your primary care physician. Your health and well-being is our greatest concern.

Often times, we are able to give samples of medications to try prior to writing a prescription. Unfortunately, we are unable to keep patients supplied with these medications indefinitely.

	•	Medical records and Privacy Policy
Hixson Urology follows HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) guidelines and accordingly maintains all information related to patients and medical care in the strictest confidence. For more information, please download HIPAA's fact sheet “Your Health Information Privacy Rights.” [link to www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/consumers/consumer_summary.pdf]
We will not disclose your record to others unless you direct us to do so or unless the law authorizes or compels us to do so. With appropriate authorization, copies of a portion or all of your medical records will be released to the appropriate party or designated person(s).
In order for us to release your records, please fill out our permission to RELEASE medical records form. [PDF link]  In the event that you would like us to obtain your records, please fill out our permission to OBTAIN medical records form. [PDF link]

	•	After hours/On-call
Our Physicians share on-call responsibilities. If you need to speak to a doctor after regular office hours, our answering service will contact the physician on-call and your call will be returned promptly — to reach the answering service, call our office number at (423) 877-2844. Our answering service will relay your message to the physician on call.
If you need more emergent assistance, please call 911 or go to the nearest Emergency Room. Our doctors prefer that you go to the Memorial Hospital Hixson ER if at all possible. We have a relationship with Memorial Hospital Glenwood ER, but do not provide routine emergency assistance there. We do not have a relationship with the Parkridge ER, and you will have to be transferred by ambulance for us to see you emergently.
For non-urgent concerns, including test results, prescription refills, and appointment scheduling, please call our office during normal business hours when your records are available.
	•	Telephone calls
We welcome and encourage you to call the office if you have a problem or question. In order for us to prioritize calls, we ask patients to let the receptionist know the nature of your problem or questions. Genuine emergencies are our first priority. Urgent calls are handled as soon as possible, and non-emergent calls are returned as time permits throughout the day and after office hours.
	•	Test results
Lab and radiology test results will be given out by the doctor or medical assistant only.  However, test results will only be released after the doctor has had a chance to review them.  There is a wide variance regarding how long various results can take. Please understand that we aim to provide you with the most precise and accurate results possible, which sometimes take more time than we would like. If you have not been informed of your test results within seven business days, please call us.
	•	Work forms
Our office staff will complete FMLA and work disability forms upon request.  Please download the following form for information [PDF].
