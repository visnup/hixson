Small practice feel. Big practice results.
==========================================

At Hixson Urology, we pride ourselves on providing cutting-edge urology on a
personal level. We recognize how important our patients are, and we treat them
with the respect they deserve. We have live office staff answer our phones. We
offer same-day appointments for emergencies. Our experienced, board-certified
urologists use advanced treatments to manage a broad spectrum of urological
problems, including minimally invasive urologic procedures. In short, we
provide the individual attention that we hope separates us from the rest.
